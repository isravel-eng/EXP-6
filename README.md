## AIM  
To measure the output voltage with respect to the displacement of the core in an LVDT kit and to plot the graphical relationship between displacement and output voltage.

## APPARATUS  
- LVDT Kit  
- Multimeter

## THEORY  
LVDT (Linear Variable Differential Transformer) is a mutual inductance type transducer used for measuring linear displacement. It consists of one primary coil and two identical secondary coils wound symmetrically on either side of the primary coil.

When the primary coil is excited with an AC supply and the core is at the null position, equal voltages are induced in both secondary coils. These secondary coils are connected in series opposition, resulting in zero output voltage.

When the core moves away from the null position, the induced voltage in one secondary increases while it decreases in the other. This produces a differential output voltage whose magnitude is proportional to the displacement of the core. The relationship between displacement and output voltage is linear over a limited range. A small residual voltage may be present at the null position due to capacitive coupling and practical imperfections.

## PROCEDURE  
1. Connect the multimeter to the output terminals of the LVDT kit.  
2. Set the displacement range to a maximum of 10 mm.  
3. Move the core gradually from the zero position to a maximum of 20 mm.  
4. Note the corresponding output voltage readings from the multimeter.  
5. Plot a graph between displacement (mm) and output voltage (V).

## PRECAUTIONS  
1. Multimeter readings should be noted carefully.  
2. The core displacement should not exceed 20 mm.  
3. Perform the experiment at normal room temperature for accurate results.  
4. Ensure the power supply is 220 V ±10% at 50 Hz to avoid voltage hazards.

## RESULT  
The characteristics of the LVDT were studied. The graph between displacement and output voltage was found to be linear over a specific range of displacement.
